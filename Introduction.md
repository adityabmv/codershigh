This is a initiative by Professor Sudarshan Iyengar (IIT Ropar) and his students. This club is all about discussions and promoting the concept of learning while teaching.

The club is a factory of great ideas, where the youth from pan India build up the curriculum to be taught for the generations to come by learning what's already there.
